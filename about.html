                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>Founded in [Year], Coffee was born out of a passion for exceptional coffee and a desire to create a
                    welcoming space for the community. What started as a small dream has grown into a beloved local
                    spot, where every cup is crafted with care and every customer is family.</p>
                <p>We believe in the power of a good cup of coffee to bring people together, inspire conversations, and
                    brighten days. Our journey has been fueled by dedication, continuous learning, and a commitment to
                    serving only the best.</p>

                <div class="sourcing-content">
                    <p>We meticulously select our beans from ethical and sustainable farms around the world. Our direct
                        relationships with growers ensure fair practices and the highest quality produce. Each batch of
                        beans is roasted in-house daily, using state-of-the-art equipment and time-honored traditions.
                        This allows us to bring out the unique flavor profiles and aromas that make our coffee truly
